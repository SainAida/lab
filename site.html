		<h3>Purchasing Power</h3>
			<p>Used books are often treasures that are out-of-print or rare. With Wish Lists you can choose to be notified the instant we find a copy, see how often we find rare titles, and see who else is interested.</p>
		</div>
	<div class="ABOUT-US-col">
		<h3>A new way to choose</h3>
		<p>Searching book sites usually means keying in an author’s name or a book title. But if you know the name already, your search is likely to turn up books you’ve already heard about. No surprises there.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="ABOUT-US-col">
			<h3>Choosing books by mood and emotion</h3>
			<p>You can mix our mood sliders into great combinations - try unpredictable, lots of sex and optimistic and check what comes up. Flip the slider setting from optimistic to unusual and the books offered are quite different.</p>
